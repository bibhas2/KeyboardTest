## Keyboard Handling in iOS9
This demo code shows how to move text fields with animation when keyboard opens or closes. The following features are addressed:

- Move only text boxes that will be obscured by an open keyboard.
- Move a text box only slightly above the keyboard.
- Hide keyboard when user taps anywhere on screen that can't take focus.
- Make keyboard management generic that can be used from any controller.
